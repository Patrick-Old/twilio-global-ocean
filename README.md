# Ahoy! Are You Ready for Climate Model Data Analysis?
### Let's sail the high seas together through the analysis of a global oceanographic climate model.

In this mini-workshop we will be working with data from one of the world's best climate models as we build toward an understanding of its structure and meaning.

# Setup

All of our code will be written in Python (specifically, Python 3). To get setup correctly, please ensure you have Python installed on your machine. If it is not, you can install it from the official page [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Below, we will create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python packages to the virtual environment. We can then use either the command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac) to run the following commands in the local git repository.

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create the virtual environment.

`python3 -m venv climate`

3. Activate the virtual environment.

On Mac: `source climate/bin/activate`

On Windows: `climate\Scripts\activate.bat`

4. Make sure `pip` is up to date with the following command.

`pip install --upgrade pip`

5. Install all packages using `pip` to the virtual environment.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

If this is not working well for you, please use the following video tutorial to potentially address your challenges.

6. Launch Jupyter Notebook via the command below, and navigate to the "notebooks" folder to begin your voyage.

`jupyter notebook .`
